## Tasks

- ~~Update Projects page to "Work" page. More general yet more professional.~~
- Format projects and blog with MDX.
- ~~Update custom typography styling to use tailwind typography.~~
- ~~Change work page slug from id to project name. This is more descriptive.~~
- Add colorful and dynamic drop shadow to each of the tools.
- Move mdx files to database.
- Fix footer to the bottom of the page.
- Update color scheme. Plain black background with plain white text is hurting my eyes.
